# Introduction
This AnyGateway plug-in enables issuance, revocation, and synchronization of certificates from <Company> <Product> offering.  
# Prerequisites

## Certificate Chain

In order to enroll for certificates the Keyfactor Command server must trust the trust chain. Once you create your Root and/or Subordinate CA, make sure to import the certificate chain into the AnyGateway and Command Server certificate store


# Install
* Download latest successful build from [GitHub Releases](../../releases/latest)

* Copy <GatewayDLL>.dll to the Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor AnyGateway directory

* Update the CAProxyServer.config file
  * Update the CAConnection section to point at the DigiCertCAProxy class
  ```xml
  <alias alias="CAConnector" type="Keyfactor.Extensions.AnyGateway.Company.Product.GatewayNameCAConnector, DLLName"/>
  ```

# Configuration
The following sections will breakdown the required configurations for the AnyGatewayConfig.json file that will be imported to configure the AnyGateway.

## Templates
The Template section will map the CA's products to an AD template.
* ```ProductID```
This is the ID of the <Product> product to map to the specified template.

 ```json
  "Templates": {
	"WebServer": {
      "ProductID": "<productID>",
      "Parameters": {
      }
   }
}
 ```
 
## Security
The security section does not change specifically for the <Product> CA Gateway.  Refer to the AnyGateway Documentation for more detail.
```json
  /*Grant permissions on the CA to users or groups in the local domain.
	READ: Enumerate and read contents of certificates.
	ENROLL: Request certificates from the CA.
	OFFICER: Perform certificate functions such as issuance and revocation. This is equivalent to "Issue and Manage" permission on the Microsoft CA.
	ADMINISTRATOR: Configure/reconfigure the gateway.
	Valid permission settings are "Allow", "None", and "Deny".*/
    "Security": {
        "Keyfactor\\Administrator": {
            "READ": "Allow",
            "ENROLL": "Allow",
            "OFFICER": "Allow",
            "ADMINISTRATOR": "Allow"
        },
        "Keyfactor\\gateway_test": {
            "READ": "Allow",
            "ENROLL": "Allow",
            "OFFICER": "Allow",
            "ADMINISTRATOR": "Allow"
        },		
        "Keyfactor\\SVC_TimerService": {
            "READ": "Allow",
            "ENROLL": "Allow",
            "OFFICER": "Allow",
            "ADMINISTRATOR": "None"
        },
        "Keyfactor\\SVC_AppPool": {
            "READ": "Allow",
            "ENROLL": "Allow",
            "OFFICER": "Allow",
            "ADMINISTRATOR": "Allow"
        }
    }
```
## CerificateManagers
The Certificate Managers section is optional.
	If configured, all users or groups granted OFFICER permissions under the Security section
	must be configured for at least one Template and one Requester. 
	Uses "<All>" to specify all templates. Uses "Everyone" to specify all requesters.
	Valid permission values are "Allow" and "Deny".
```json
  "CertificateManagers":{
		"DOMAIN\\Username":{
			"Templates":{
				"MyTemplateShortName":{
					"Requesters":{
						"Everyone":"Allow",
						"DOMAIN\\Groupname":"Deny"
					}
				},
				"<All>":{
					"Requesters":{
						"Everyone":"Allow"
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
```

  "CAConnection": {

  },
```
